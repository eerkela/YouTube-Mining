# YouTube-Mining

This is a personal library to download and parse youtube videos from selected socio-political channels in what's called the online "culture war."  My hope is to some day reconstruct a searchable timeline of events in the culture war using the data contained in this video collection.

# Channel Selection
Channels were gathered from several sources: (1) transparency.tube (https://transparency.tube/), (2) Rebecca Lewis's Alternative Influence Report (a copy of which is included in the repository), and (3) personal curation, mostly in that order.
